                San Francisco is the city of the future. Let's make it 10x
                better.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our city has a lot of problems, but even more potential. For
                better or worse, San Francisco defines the future of our whole
                society. Momentum is on the side of San Francisco turning around
                and becoming truly great, but it needs help.
            </p>
            <p>
                The SF10x project is gathering energetic people who believe in
                this city and love building things. We organize events and
                projects to help San Francisco live up to its destiny as the
                city of the future.
            </p>

            <h3>OUR FIVE THESES:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        San Francisco is under-developed, especially housing and
                        transportation.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Our children should be able to walk barefoot on any
                        street in the city.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The SF government should be lean, meritocratic, and
                        magnificent.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Families should move to San Francisco for the schools
                        and family infrastructure, not away.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        San Francisco should be at the center of an American
                        industrial renaissance.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>OUR CURRENT PROJECTS:</h3>
            <p>
                We meet every Sunday at 2:30pm at the bell in Dolores Park to
                pick up trash and talk about how to make the city better. Come
                join us!
            </p>

            <p>
                Our first SF10x civics hackathon will be held
                <a href="https://lu.ma/pvc2ivh5">August 1st-3rd</a> at Frontier
                Tower to bring together civics and technology people to
                prototype useful projects over a weekend.
            </p>

                Our operatives have been valiantly keeping the
                <a href="https://www.bernalswing.com/">Bernal Heights swing</a>
                in service against the misguided efforts of the no-fun-allowed
                department.
