                We throw parties and do projects to make the best city in the
                world 10x better.
            </p>

            <p>
                This city has a lot of problems, but even more potential.
                Momentum is on the side of San Francisco turning around and
                becoming a truly great city. It just needs a little push. We
                want to help by gathering together energetic people who love
                this city and love building things into a great party in all
                senses of the word.
            </p>

            <h3>OUR FIVE THESES:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        San Francisco is under-developed, especially housing and
                        transportation.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Our children should be able to walk barefoot on any
                        street in the city.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The SF government could be small, meritocratic, and
                        magnificent.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Families should move to San Francisco for the public
                        schools, not away.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        San Francisco would be at the center of America's
                        industrial renaissance.
                    </p>

                Our first SF civics hackathon will be held
                <a href="https://lu.ma/pvc2ivh5">June 27th-29th</a> to bring
                together civics and technology people to prototype useful

            </p>

            <p>
                Our operatives have been valiantly keeping the
                <a href="https://www.bernalswing.com/">Bernal Heights swing</a>
                in service against the misguided efforts of the no-fun-allowed
                department.
